# 🍽️ Lunch Tracker

A simple, collaborative repository to track **where we go for lunch**.

This repo helps us:

* Remember places we’ve already tried
* Avoid eating the same thing every day
* Share recommendations and notes
* Decide where to go next more easily

---

## 📌 What This Repo Is For

We use this repository to log:

* Lunch locations (restaurants, food trucks, cafeterias, etc.)
* Dates visited
* Who went
* Quick notes (price, wait time, what was good, what wasn’t)

It’s intentionally lightweight and low-maintenance.
